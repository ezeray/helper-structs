# Result

This is a very small project, in which after learning a bit of Rust, I wanted
to have an equivalent to the Result<T, E> type. I've been working on and off
on something like this for some time, but have always kept it around my
local machine, so thought it'd be useful for myself and any other projects
to have it be installable and used in any project from a venv instead of
copying the module around.

## Ideas

Initially I created a result type that was more like a common monad, but later
I found another github project which created a Result and an Option type,
following the rust implementations closer. I'm taking what I found useful from
that repo but keeping it around my own usage and interests.
